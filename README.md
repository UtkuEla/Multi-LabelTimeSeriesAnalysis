# ProjectArbeit
Repo for Summer23 Project Arbeit

test_data and train_data folders contains the datasets I have been using.

main.py is the main script for combining all the other code and training.

However, I am using google colab for training and testing ideas so the main.py script is not up-to-date.

At the end, main.py will be the final script.

readme will be updated.

# ideas to try:

300 - 150 - 50 sampling rates with a 10% overlap

K-fold-Cross-Validation instead of train-test split

Examining more metrics since 98% accuracy is good but might be hiding the big picture!

Take away the NoFault and Outliers class and try to model again!

Multi-Label classification from a single-label dataset is the keyword!

Z-normalization for drift dataset(will be applied to all)! Maybe it can solve the dominance issue.
